## ðŸ†• News
- \[**Sep 2023**\] Our paper has been accepted to **NeurIPS 2023 Datasets and Benchmarks Track!**
- \[**Sep 2023**\] We released the second version (v2) of our paper, we added extra LLMs **(GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Davinci-003, LLama2, Galactica)** experiments; more baselines, and more investigations on **SELFIES**, and label interpretation!
- \[**May 2023**\] We released the first version (v1) of our paper! Very glad to share our investigations and insights about LLM in chemistry!

## ðŸ“Œ Prompt
The followings are our prompt used in the paper. It's extremely easy to try your own designed prompt! Only need to change the prompt in the Jupyter code of each task and then we can see the results and performance.
### Zero-shot Prompt
